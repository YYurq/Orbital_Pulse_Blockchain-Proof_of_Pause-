# ORBITAL Pulse Blockchain  
**Proof of Pause / Proof of Pulse**

On-chain implementation of the **Law of Admission** and **TPAPCI**
(Theory of Phase Architecture of Pulsational Convergence of Information)
on the Solana blockchain.

---

## Overview

**Orbital Pulse Blockchain** is an experimental on-chain protocol that implements
a deterministic emission system with an element of external noise.
The system formalizes the idea of *pause* as a measurable and verifiable state
derived from blockchain hash entropy.

Token emission occurs **only** when the system reaches a resonant state
(Proof of Pause), demonstrating the principle of *noise as fuel*.

## Core Concepts

### Law of Admission
A system transition is permitted only when internal state, external noise,
and admissible thresholds converge within a defined tolerance.

### TPAPCI
**Theory of Phase Architecture of Pulsational Convergence of Information** —
a theoretical framework describing how information systems self-organize
through phase states, pulsations, and resonance under noisy conditions.

### Proof of Pause/Pulse (PoP)
A consensus-independent emission trigger based on:
- hash entropy
- deterministic state checks
- epsilon-based admissibility conditions

## On-chain Implementation

- **Program ID**:  
  `3o6We5WQoGDM6wpQMPq5VE3fjvC7zgCUD56X12vLn917`

- **Network**:  
  Solana Devnet

- **Framework**:  
  Anchor (Rust)

The program:
1. Initializes a system state
2. Evaluates entropy-derived parameters
3. Detects resonant pause states
4. Emits the $ORBIT token only when conditions are satisfied

Each successful initialization represents an independent and verifiable
genesis event recorded on-chain.

### English Summary

This project implements the *Law of Admission* as an on-chain system
where information convergence is governed by phase stability and noise.
The blockchain acts as an external entropy source and a verifier of state transitions.
