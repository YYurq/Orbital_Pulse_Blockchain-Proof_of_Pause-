# Orbital_Pulse_Blockchain-Proof_of_Pause
Orbital Pulse Blockchain is an experimental on‑chain protocol implementing the Law of Admission and TPAPCI (Theory of Phase Architecture of Pulsational Convergence of Information) as a deterministic system with external noise. The program detects resonant pause states via blockchain hash entropy and uses them to trigger $ORBIT token emission.
